# Preference Fullstack Project

Editable issue list.

First run `npm install`.

Note that the project uses mongodb as a database server. You will need to install and configure it correctly. The `dbname` the app uses is issuesdb.

You can live preview the app on https://mighty-chamber-32704.herokuapp.com/.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
This is then served with the **Express** app.


### `npm start`
Runs the server.
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run dev`
Runs the **REACT** app in the development mode with a `dev proxy` to port 4000.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
